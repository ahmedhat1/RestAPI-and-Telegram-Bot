# RestAPI-and-Telegram-Bot
This project is about using the FlickrAPI to download images of dogs, cats, and alligators.
The images are then resized and saved in the 'images' directory. The project also includes a class to train a model on these images,
and a telegram bot callback that sends messages to a telegram bot after each epoch of the training process.
The user needs to provide their own personal token for the telegram bot to function properly.
The script also uses Tensorflow and the MobileNetV2 model for training.
